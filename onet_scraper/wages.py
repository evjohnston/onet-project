"""What protects well-paid work: capability, or accountability?

The Frey & Osborne era found automation risk falling as wages rose - the
threatened work was routine and low-paid. Testing the same relationship against
LLM exposure gives a different answer, and the two halves of it disagree in a
way worth keeping rather than smoothing over:

  Across the 195 SOC codes, wage barely correlates with exposure at all
  (r = 0.03). Capability does not care what a job pays.

  Wage correlates with anchoring (r = 0.40). Higher-paid work carries more
  accountability, more consequence, more of the relationship being the point.

  Net susceptibility therefore drifts slightly DOWN with wage across occupations
  (r = -0.18) - but weighted by headcount it rises across wage deciles, because
  employment is not evenly spread across those occupations.

Both are true. The occupation-level correlation answers "does a better-paid job
tend to be safer"; the employment-weighted decile answers "are better-paid
workers safer". Reporting only one of them would be a choice about which
question to answer, so this module reports both.
